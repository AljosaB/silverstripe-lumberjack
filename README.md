A module to make managing pages in a GridField easy without losing any of the functionality that you're used to in the CMS.

This is intended to be used in cases where the SiteTree grows beyond a manageable level. eg. blogs, news sections, shops, etc.

This module was born out of and decoupled from [micmania1/silverstripe-blog](https://github.com/micmania1/silverstripe-blogger).

## Features

* Easily define which page types to show in the SiteTree and which to manage in a GridField.
